# 👋 Hi, I'm Nicholas!

## 🚗 Automotive Leader • Iraq War Purple Heart Veteran • DIY Car Enthusiast

I’m a proud U.S. Marine Corps veteran who served in Iraq from 2001 to 2004 and was awarded the Purple Heart for injuries sustained while protecting my fellow Marines. My mission has always been to help others — whether on the battlefield or in the garage.
